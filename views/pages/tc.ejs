        connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or its

        third
        party trademarks.</p>

    <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors,
        officers,
        employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special,

        of
        content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
        however
        caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of
        statutory
        duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages
        or could
        have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the
        Operator
        and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be
        limited to an
        amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one
        month
        period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also
        apply

        to the
        extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so
        that they
        will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision
        of this
        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the
        intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
